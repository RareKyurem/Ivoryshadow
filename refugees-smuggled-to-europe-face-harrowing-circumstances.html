	    	<p class ="maintext">Refugees have long since "traveled" to Europe to escape conditions in their home country. But we haven't heard the worst of their struggles yet.
</p>
		<p class ="maintext">African refugees who arrived in Europe received treatment and were diagnosed with hydrocarbon pneumonia, which is caused by consumption of gasoline.
</p>
		<p class ="maintext">Doctors were able to confirm that the cause of all these refugees coming to Europe with hydrocarbon pneumonia is the traffickers themselves.
The traffickers fed the refugees diesel to drink and gave them parasite infested food.</p>
    <p class ="maintext">The lack of quality food and the qualities imbued with each of them helps accomplish the traffickers' goals. The diesel and parasite infested food make them lethargic and too weak to protest or swim, making the illegal traffickers' jobs much easier. Furthermore, they aren't often fed, making the gasoline and plastic food their only choice. Many people often die, and organ-harvesting is obviously occurring.
</p>
    <p class ="maintext">Seven months ago, the mutilated bodies of nine Somalis came up ashore in Egypt. Their organs were removed.
</p>
<p class ="maintext">I guess their previous homeland was even worse than this. That's why they can bear through the pain.</p>
