                        <p class = "maintext">Hi! I’m going to introduce myself so you guys are completely confused by my tone and style. My name’s Matthew and I live in Irvine. I am logical, and am willing to talk seriously, straightforward, and I have sarcastic and satirical views. (I’m also cynical hehehe) If you saw me normally, you would think I'm innocent. I'm not. I'm too sanctimonious and arrogant for my age. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ However, I’m not inconsiderate (yay morals!). I have strong against some things and I’m a very quirky and unusual guy. On a normal day, you wouldn’t even notice me. (but you probably notice me now since I just said it) You’ll probably see me strolling around with a gray jacket with jeans on. </p>
                 	<p class = "maintext">I’m a teen (haha weird right?) in high school as a sophomore. I’m pretty much just a normal kid. (I’m that short asian nerdy kid) I live in the sunny, affluent Irvine, where everyone is rich except for my family. My family kinda has less income. /(;-_-)/ Still, I’m acting kind of privileged, and Irvine’s average income is one of the highest. I'm not complaining, I just think that my family’s medium income makes me special. I'm pretty conservative with food and stuff. I do stay home a lot prepping for tests and homework 1 month in advance. ;( I have no life. I enjoy watching anime so that inspired me to learn Japanese and I enjoy coding. Taking the JLPT N5 in December! Woop woop. </p>
			<p class = "maintext"> My life? I pretty much just stay home the whole day. I just prep for tests and homework 1 month in advance. ;( (and make this website) I have no life. I often cringe and scorn when I see people who always HAVE to procrastinate until the last day. I don't even know wtf they do when they get home.</p>
			<p class = "maintext">Yes, I'm an otaku. (Don' Hate) I enjoy watching anime so that inspired me to learn Japanese. Taking the JLPT N5 in December! Woop woop. I enjoy coding, so that's why I made this website. Another thing that I enjoy as an hobby is cubing, as in solving a Rubik's cube. I also to go out for exercising, and more recently, POKEMON GO! #GOTEAMMYSTIC</p>
