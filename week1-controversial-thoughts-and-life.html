                        <p class = "maintext">Yay, first blog ever detailing my normal life. Woop. My wonderfully amazing life living on this amazing planet. Yay controversial thoughts that will probably land me into a heap of hate. . ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Or maybe not. Maybe peeps out there actually understand me. Detailing my wonderful life and my thoughts about them.</p>
                 	<p class = "maintext">So recently, I went to a wedding. You know, a wedding, as in “a marriage ceremony, especially considered as including the associated celebrations”. So apparently, wedding has, all this time, been a ceremony, not a binding of couples. I guess our society has been so centered on materialism that we associate a wedding ceremony as the actual wedding. Come to think of it, most of the time, a “wedding” only minutely consists the actual bonding of the two partners. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Welp. This world.</p>
                 	<p class ="maintext">On Friday, I went to a movie theater. I kinda loathe activites that I can’t receive the benefits of after the action is finished. This includes movies, amusement parks, video games; basically every form of entertainment. That’s not to say I don’t like entertainment, I just hate myself (and I’m pissed) after its finished, because that activity can’t be conjured up into a form of happiness for me. (cuz after you play video games, you still gotta finish up that 30 page essay) That’s why I despise being dragged out to go do one of these activities. (suks to be a kid) At least video games with progression I can at least feel that I’ve done something. *cough* games with no purpose *cough* (I confess that I’ve wasted time watching videoes. In fact, I’m watching one right now. Lol) </p>
			<p class = "maintext">I just finished taking Health class, the class that everyone that just gets over with. We were watching a documentary, Fed Up, and it really got to me. That film was talking about the U.S. Food Brands and Government paradoxical partnerships and the obesity and health concerns. For examples, the USDA, who long advocated for less portions, obviously should partner up with all the major food corporations, amirite? It doesn’t take a genius to tell that there is a tiny bit of corruptness hanging around these organizations. Especially when health organizations, such as the WHO, suddenly change their resolution plans to take it easy on junk food. And the lobbyists advocating that junk food is healthy. yep yep. k.</p>
			<p class = "maintext">Overall, this was kind of a slow week. (cuz summer, just lounging around, studying as usual. No people to hate against)</p>
