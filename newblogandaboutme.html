<p class = "caption">	"this is my description of me"</p>
                        <p class = "maintext">Hi. This is my blog that I just started. I coded it myself, so yay! This blog will be focusing on my life’s daily events, my thoughts on the news, and really, whatever you guys want me to talk about. I am logical, and am willing to talk seriously, straightforward, and not I don’t if I offend anyone. However, I am not inconsiderate, don’t think of me as that. I just have strong views about some situations and some people’s attitude and I think that people in this day and age are way too sensitive over the most trivial of things.</p>
                 	<p class = "maintext">I’m also willing to reconsider and open to change. That’s what comments are for. Tell me down in the comments about your thoughts, and I’ll consider it. Comments can be used to give suggestions, comments (of course), questions, or just having a friendly chat with other users. The comments are Facebook-powered, so hopefully you guys have Facebook accounts, or you’ll just have to make one. I don’t know if anyone out there in the world will enjoy my content, but this is a big world, so I assume some people will enjoy this. </p>
			<p class = "maintext"> I’m a teen (haha weird right?) in high school as a sophomore. I’m pretty much just a normal kid. The picture in this blog post is what I think describes me. Find me anyday, and I will pretty much look like that (except with glasses). I’m the kid in the back seat with glasses who no one talks to. ;( </p>
			<p class = "maintext"> On this blog, there are two types of blogs: Weekly Rants, and the Regular Blogs. Every week, you guys will vote on Strawpoll for what topic you guys want me to talk about. Weekly Rants are my thoughts put into the form of a tangent (and rant of course) about anything you guys want. The Weekly Rant Strawpoll always changes every week, and is located on the top right nav bar.</p>
			<p class = "maintext">  Sometimes, another Strawpoll is needed that pertains to something other than the Weekly Rant, so I’ll put that in one of my regular blog posts. This Week’s Extra Strawpoll is about what days you guys want me to release a new blog. Every week has two blogs, so vote for one day you want me to make a new blog, and the next blog will be released 3-4 days later. </p>
			<p class = "maintext"> Suggestions, comments, and questions can also emailed to this blog’s email: kuriteblog@gmail.com  </p>
			<p class = "maintext"> Also, many of you may be wondering about why this site is named Kurite. Kurite is a combination of the Japanese word for black, kuro, and white. The whole site’s format is black and white, my two favorite colors. Black and white are also colors, and that represents my difference from many other types of people, and that also represents my difference in opinion from many people too. </p>
			<p class = "maintext"> Here’s the icon for this blog: </p>
			<img class ="pictureinsert" src="http://i1339.photobucket.com/albums/o711/RareKyurem/146837969960638_zpsfrmhk3ip.gif" border="0" alt=" photo 146837969960638_zpsfrmhk3ip.gif"/>
			<p class = "maintext"> The two Japanese/Chinese characters are　黒(kuro/hei) and　白(shiro/bai) meaning black and white, respectively. </p>
