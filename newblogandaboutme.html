                        <p class = "maintext">Hi. This is my blog that I just started. I coded it myself, so yay! This blog will be focusing on my life’s daily events, my thoughts on the news, and really, whatever you guys want me to talk about. I am logical, and am willing to talk seriously, straightforward, and I have sarcastic and satirical views (lel). If you saw me normally, you would think I'm innocent. I'm not. I'm too santicmous and arrogant for my age. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ However, I’m not inconsiderate (yay morals!). I just have strong views about some situations and some people’s attitude and I think that people in this day and age are way too sensitive over the most trivial of things.</p>
                 	<p class = "maintext">I’m also willing to reconsider and I’m open to change. That’s what comments are for. Tell me down in the comments about your thoughts, and I’ll consider it. Comments can be used to give suggestions, comments (of course), questions, or just having a friendly chat with other users. I don’t know if anyone out there in the world will enjoy my content, but this is a big world, so I assume some people will enjoy this. I hope this blog will allow me to meet other people like me. yay! Since Disqus, the comment provider that I use, is very stiff on its comment customization, whenever you guys comment enclose it .in anchor tags. If you don’t, the comment will appear dark gray, blending into the black background. </p>

                 	<p class ="maintext">It’s ok if you forget. Mods can edit it to change it. </p>
			<p class = "maintext">I’m a teen (haha weird right?) in high school as a sophomore. I’m pretty much just a normal kid. I live in the sunny, affluent Irvine, where everyone is rich except for my family. My family kinda has less income. /(;-_-)/ Still, I’m acting kind of privileged, and Irvine’s average income is one of the highest. I'm not complaining, I just think that my family’s medium income makes me special. I'm pretty conservative with food and stuff. I do stay home a lot prepping for tests and homework 1 month in advance. ;( I have no life. I enjoy watching anime so that inspired me to learn Japanese and I enjoy coding. Taking the JLPT N5 in December! Woop woop.</p>
			<p class = "maintext">My life? I pretty much just stay home the whole day. I just prep for tests and homework 1 month in advance. ;( I have no life. I often cringe and scorn when I see people who always HAVE to procrastinate until the last day. I don't even know wtf they do when they get home.</p>
			<p class = "maintext">Yes, I'm an otaku. (Don' Hate) I enjoy watching anime so that inspired me to learn Japanese. Taking the JLPT N5 in December! Woop woop. I enjoy coding, so that's why I made this website. Another thing that I enjoy as an hobby is cubing, as in solving a Rubik's cube. I also to go out for exercising, and more recently, POKEMON GO! #GOTEAMMYSTIC </p>
			<p class = "maintext">The main picture in this blog post is what I think describes me. I wear my jacket all the time. ALL THE TIME. EVEN IN THE DESERT. I’m the kid in the back seat with glasses who no one talks to. ;(</p>
			<p class = "maintext">On this blog, there are two types of blogs: Weekly Rants, and the Regular Blogs. Every week, you guys will vote on Strawpoll for what topic you guys want me to talk about. Weekly Rants are my thoughts put into the form of a tangent (and rant of course) about anything you guys want. The Weekly Rant Strawpoll always changes every week, and is located on the top right nav bar.</p>
			<p class = "maintext">Sometimes, another Strawpoll is needed that pertains to something other than the Weekly Rant, so I’ll put that in one of my regular blog posts. This Week’s Extra Strawpoll is about what days you guys want me to release a new blog. Every week has two blogs, so vote for one day you want me to make a new blog, and the next blog will be released 3-4 days later. Here’s that Strawpoll right here:</p>
			<p class = "maintext">Tell me in the comments how many times you want me to post. Everyday, every other day, 2 times a week. I don't know what you guys want. </p>
			<p class ="maintext"> I’m starting a subscription for this blog. Email kuriteblog@gmail.com saying that you want to be subscribed to the email subscription, and whenever a new blog is posted, you guys will be the first to know.</p>
			<p class = "maintext"> You may be wondering about why this site is named Kurite. Kurite is a combination of the Japanese word for black, kuro, and white. The whole site’s format is black and white, my two favorite colors.  Black and white are also opposing colors, and that represents my difference from many other types of people, and that also represents my difference in opinion from many people too. </p>
			<p class = "maintext">This is the icon for this blog: </p>
			<img class ="pictureinsert" src="http://i1339.photobucket.com/albums/o711/RareKyurem/146837969960638_zpsfrmhk3ip.gif" border="0" alt=" photo 146837969960638_zpsfrmhk3ip.gif"/>
			<p class = "maintext">The two Japanese/Chinese characters are  黒(kuro/hei) and  白(shiro/bai) meaning black and white, respectively. Yeah, I know. It's a horrible icon. :( I made it on ms paint lol.</p>
			<p class = "maintext">Also, every week, I will put a hidden link on the homepages, just for funsies. Send me your username along with where you found it. I'll put your name on the next blog.</p>
			<p class = "maintext">I put small social media symbols on the bottom right. I don't even like social media. Aah well. Tell me if I should make social media accounts for this blog since apparently it's what all the cool kids use. Maybe I could use it to detail my life, and post whenever I go somewhere interesting or see some very stuck-up or society-infringing acts.</p>
			<p class = "maintext">Suggestions, comments, and questions can also emailed to this blog’s email: kuriteblog@gmail.com</p>
			<p class = "maintext">Enough drivel. Welcome to Kurite! Yay. \(^.^)/</p>
