	<h2 class = "title" > Week 2: Overpopulation and Stuff</h2>
		</div>
<p class = "time"> Sunday, July 31th, 10:00 P.M. </p>
		<img  style="border:5px solid #FFFFFF" width = "700" id = "mainpicture" src = "http://sthopd.net/imgx/humanoverpopulation/cartoons/cartoon_overpopulation_on_a_full_plate.jpg">	
<p class = "caption">	"people need to stop just being people, and getting down and supporting the Earth"</p>
                        <p class = "maintext">Yay, more of my overly critical thoughts relating to my week’s thoughts and experiences. </p>
                 	<p class = "maintext">I probably don’t have much to talk about this week. I haven’t really done much interesting this week, partly because it’s summer. Summer is going by so fast, and I’ve feel like I haven’t really done anything. (But I have finished 3 SAT Prep Books, 2 AP Books, Learnt a lot of Japanese, and Made this Website) Ugh, back to another scorching, arduous, and grueling 2 weeks of band camp. Granted, it is fun, but sure, it is exasperation. </p>
                 	<p class ="maintext">Something I also randomly thought about this week is the issue of overpopulation. Maybe people should actually try to contribute to this world, and maybe the world should focus on resourcefulness instead on increasing our lifespan. I’m just thinking about this world, and there is a TON of people. I always get pissed whenever death statistics are released, because the death percentage ratio is so miniscule in proportion to the world’s population. For example, if 2 person dies a second, that’s 1% of the world’s population gone in a year. That’s minute. In comparison people are grieving over 100 or even 1000 people. I know, there’s the human factor, but in reality, it means nothing. If people are dying of starvation in developing countries, and people are impaired by diabetes and obesity in developed countries, maybe people could use money to fund development projects in developing countries. Yeah, let’s kill two birds with one stone. We should really be using our money properly, and maybe supporting the developing countries’ development so birth rate can decrease. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Hopefully I don’t come off as pessimistic lol. Phew, that was long.</p>
			<p class = "maintext">Also, I’m going to change the site’s website name. I’m thinking of Kurakage, meaning a dark shadow. The reason I’m changing it is that kurite.com is already taken, so that sucks. Polls will be located below. There’s going to be two, one for what you guys want for next week, and one for whether you like Kurakage for the site’s new name.</p>
			<p class = "maintext">Also, I’m going to Hawaii. I might not post next week. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
			<p class = "maintext">Yeah, that’s all for this week. Give me more ideas for rants and stuf. (P.S. I'm still editing this.)</p>
