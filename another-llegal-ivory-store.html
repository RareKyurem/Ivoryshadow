			<p class = "maintext">More and more African Savannah Elephants have been slaughtered for their tusks, a cloudy white material called ivory. Ivory can be used in carvings, but it is illegal. Two undercover men had caught an illegal ivory story red-handed when they successfully bought an ivory statue from a store in New York. After testing, the figure was tested to be ivory, and that warranted a search. </p>
			<p class = "maintext">126 ivory items were found, with a total sum of 4.5 million dollars. The owner, who are brothers, were arrested on account of not having an ivory license. The items will be destroyed on World Elephant Day. :(
</p>
			<p class = "maintext">I am very sad that this is happening. I know that the people killing these elephants are in poverty, and this is the only way they can make decent money, but sooner or later, this resource will run out. When this resource runs out, we can't have ivory anymore, or have those picturesque African savannah images anymore. I'm also very sad that all confiscated ivory will be destroyed. It is probably because officials don't want it recirculating and encouraging more elephant killing. However, if these elephants are about to go extinct, why can't we keep these treasures that they left up. Why let their lives go in vain?</p>
