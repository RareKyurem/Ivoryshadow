			<p class = "maintext">A blogger by the name of Ruslan Sokolovsky heard that you could receive jail time if playing Pokemon GO in church in Russia. He captured a video of himself playing PoGO at church, but no one caught him while he was filming it. He either decided to “protest” it, or just wanted to receive attention. Same thing. He only got caught after he posted a video of it, which officials then jailed him for. He knew he would be jailed, but he went in for it anyways. He has received 5 years in prison. He has launched an atheist report previously, and Russian social media users are now using the hashtag #FreeSokolovsky to call for his release. I think that’s pretty stupid because he just broke the law, and now people are calling for his release. I don’t really know what he is gaining from this, even if the law is changed. If you really wanted to play PoGo, just don’t play IN A CHURCH. That law didn’t really affect him, he just wanted attention.  He knew about the law, and he chose not to abide by it, so he faces the punishment. Hopefully he reconsiders his irrational actions in his 5 year prison sentence.
