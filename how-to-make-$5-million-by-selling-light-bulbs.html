			<p class = "maintext">Do you want to know how to make $5 million by selling light bulbs? Of course. Then follow Ivan Valdes. He worked as the Miami International Airport terminal director. He started from the bottom, as a grass cutter, but he got promoted to a management job. He hatched a devious plan with a bulb manufacturer and bought the Miami International Aiport 9,000 lightbulbs over five years. He bought the light bulbs for a grand sum $8.8 million, but the lightbulbs were only worth $3.5 million. The light bulb executives and Valdes shared the money, and now Valdes is living the dream. With his money, he bought a Porsche and lived in style - until he got arrested. He faces a ten-year prison sentence along with light bulb heads, Roy J. Bustillo, Rolando Perez and another airport executive Jose Barroso.</p>
	<p class = "maintext">This was a smart plan on Valdes' part. By partnering with a light bulb manufacturer, and being a big shot in the airport, he could "buy" light bulbs without anyone knowing. But really, if you do that math, that's about $1000 for each light bulb. Which is a lot. Anyways, bai.</p>
