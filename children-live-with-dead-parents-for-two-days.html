			<p class = "maintext">I think maybe this website should only feature stories about killings and dead people. Hmm...</p>
      <p class = "maintext">In McKeesport, Pennsylvania, a 7-year-old told a bus driver that she didn't want to go home because her parents weren't moving and they were changing colors. On that day, police responded at 5 P.M., and found the parents dead and evidence of drugs around the house. Besides the 7-year-old, there were three other kids, and all were taken to a nearby hospital for a checkup. The parents were around 25, and details about the children are not allowed to be released because they may be receiving welfare.</p>
      <p class = "maintext">Well, that's it. Bai.</p>
