			<p class = "maintext">A high school senior, Jesse Holton, is accused of murdering his parents after he was arrested. This crime occurred in the small rural town of Eclectic, Alabama.</p>
			<p class = "maintext">The whole story began of Sunday, when Jesse’s parents were angry at Jesse for trashing their house. Their house was trashed after a big party that apparently involved drugs. Jesse’s dad called the police, and the deputy arrested the son. He was in possession of marijuana, and was addicted to it, so he was appropriately charged with drug possession. When the deputy left, Jesse shot both parents in the head. He didn’t really care for them, and he didn’t ask for his father, just his mother.</p>
			<p class = "maintext">Why wasn’t he reported earlier? If he was addicted, why did his parents not know? He would have shown symptoms, and the deputy found a pot pipe in his house. Surely the parents would have found something marijuana-related sooner or later. Don’t do drugs kids.</p>
