			<p class = "maintext">A Missouri elementary school principal has just hired his friend to kill his pregnant girlfriend. The principal's name is Cornelius Green, his friend's name is Philip J.Cutler, and his girlfriend's name is Jocelyn Peters. He received two counts of murder, probably because the baby counts as an entity too.
</p>
			<p class = "maintext>Originally, only Cutler was charged with first-degree murder, but officials figured out their plan and Green was charged too. He was caught due to him leaving his car near his dead girlfriend's house. Another piece of evidence that he provided was that when he asked to call his daughter, he called Cutler and asked him to move that car. But the police were listening in. Dummy.
