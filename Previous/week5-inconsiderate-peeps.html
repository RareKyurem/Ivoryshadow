                        <p class = "maintext">Hi Guis! Because this week was mundane and uneventful, I really don’t have much to say. I had band camp, but it was quite tiring because we only got 1 minute breaks for every hour. :/ </p>
                        <p class = "maintext">Yeah, so that’s over. Geez, I experienced a ton of inconsiderate peeps at band camp. People who can’t wait for 10 minutes, people who make a big fuss of everything, and people who just can’t focus for 5 more minutes. Welp. </p>
                        <p class = "maintext">K. While waiting for lunch, and I noticed this at school too, people will cut lines for what seems to be a “long line”, when it actually probably just takes 10 minutes. It’s not like you have anything to do. I probably could make better use of that time, but with those actions, I can tell a successful life is not present in him/her. Just wait in line, skrubs. You’re not that busy, and if you that impatient, idk how you are going to succeed in school.</p>
                        <p class = "maintext">K, next story. Some kid who doesn’t understand people’s feelings always does very avoidable actions. (I’ll put it that way) He/She always does things that I personally find annoying. When I try to just relax, he/she just comes up and asks an absurd request that bothers me a lot, but does almost nothing for him/her. It’s irritating. </p>
                        <p class = "maintext">NEXT!!! Ok, in Marching Band, when the band director tells you to set, you don’t move. Now, some people freaking move, and now we need to wait 15 more seconds. It might seem minute, holding up a flute is pretty tiring, plus it’s the end of the week, plus it happens a lot. You try. Try holding out your hands over your head, in front of you for 5 minutes, and see if you want to tolerate 15 more seconds. Uggh. :(</p>
                        <p class = "maintext">Yeah, I’m perfect.</p>
