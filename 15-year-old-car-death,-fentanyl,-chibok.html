		<p class = "maintext">Notice the weird title? Its kinda hard to make a title other than "Week 12/18 News", so while not mash the news up into a weird one so you can get a sense of what is in the post.</p>

		<p class ="maintext">Tuesday saw that explosion of Mexico's most famous fireworks market, the death of 27, and the injuring of 80. Victims in the most critical conditions were helicoptered out. </p>
		<p class ="maintext">The explosion resulted in a 3-mile evacuation radius. Some of the fireworks had to be let exploded. 
</p>
		<p class ="maintext">Similar explosions in the same market happened in 2005 and 2006. </p>
		<p class ="maintext">Terrorism was not labeled a suspect.</p>

		<a href = "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/21/world/delta-air-lines-adam-saleh.html?_r=0"><p class ="sub-title">12/23:
American-born Muslims Removed Off Flight for Speaking Arabic</p></a>
		<p class ="maintext">Yay, more ignorant Americans scared of anything Middle Eastern.</p>
		<p class ="maintext">Adam Saleh, 23, and Slim Albaher, 22 were forced out of their Delta Airlines flight when speaking Arabic on the flight returning to their <em>home country</em>.</p>
		<p class ="maintext">Adam Saleh was talking with his mom on the phone in Arabic, then talked to Albaher in Arabic.</p>
		<p class ="maintext">Passengers around him became frantic because they thought they were planning a hijack or something.
</p>
		<p class ="maintext">Someone in front of him asked to speak in English, and it escalated from there.</p>
		<p class ="maintext">Not everyone who presents Middle Eastern characteristics is a terrorist.
</p>
		<p class ="maintext">Though, it does seem a bit unsettling when Saleh talked on the phone, then to Albaher.
